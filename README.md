## What is Finicons?

A simple, lightweight app (and future API) that can be used as a design resource for fintech products. Logo searching tends to be a convoluted process and getting them into a product can be time and resource consuming.

## Build

This application is built using [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/). More information on building this can be found on the official documentation

```
# install deps
$ yarn

# start dev server

```
